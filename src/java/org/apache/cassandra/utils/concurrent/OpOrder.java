         *               running, or tidying up, so unlink() fails to remove us

         * we require all to be stopped is to avoid tracking which threads are safe at any point, though we may want
         * to do so in future.
         *
         * isBlocking => a barrier that is waiting on us (either directly, or via a future Ordered) is blocking general
         * progress. This state is entered by calling Barrier.markBlocking(). If the running operations are blocked
         * on a Signal that is also registered with the isBlockingSignal (probably through isSafeBlockingSignal)
