/**
 * An object that needs ref counting does the following:
 *   - defines a Tidy object that will cleanup once it's gone,
 *     (this must retain no references to the object we're tracking (only its resources and how to clean up))
 *   - implements RefCounted
 *   - encapsulates a RefCounted.Impl, to which it proxies all calls to RefCounted behaviours
 *   - ensures no external access to the encapsulated Impl, and permits no references to it to leak
 *   - users must ensure no references to the selfRef leak, or are retained outside of a method scope either.
 *     (to ensure the selfRef is collected with the object, so that leaks may be detected and corrected)
 *
 * This class' functionality is achieved by what may look at first glance like a complex web of references,
 * but boils down to:
 *
 * Target --> Impl --> selfRef --> [RefState] <--> RefCountedState --> Tidy
 *                                        ^                ^
 *                                        |                |
 * Ref -----------------------------------                 |
 *                                                         |
 * Global -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * So that, if Target is collected, Impl is collected and, hence, so is selfRef.
 *
 * Once ref or selfRef are collected, the paired RefState's release method is called, which if it had
 * not already been called will update RefCountedState and log an error.
 *
 * Once the RefCountedState has been completely released, the Tidy method is called and it removes the global reference
 * to itself so it may also be collected.
